# Advent of Code 2021
A yearly event of coding challenges. This year I'll be using Python for some light code golfing and learning more Golang.

# Spoilers!
This entire repo is a spoiler for the event! If you do not want to see solutions, do not look at this!

# Layout
Each Day folder includes Python (and maybe Go) solutions, along with the problem spec, and data input file.
Python solutions can be run with `python3 day_<number>.py`.
Go solutions can be run with `go run day_<number>.go`.
